fast_planner/plan_env/src/edt_environment.cpp
- to check for collision
- find the distance to the nearest obstacles
- use sdf_map.cpp in edt_environment.cpp as the map type
- the specific functions under this class:
-- init()
-- prediction-related(): i guess, this is for dynamic edt_environment
    - one thing to mention, the variable 'time' is quite important for the dynamic case
-- distance-related()

fast_planner/plan_env/raycast.cpp
- to check for collisions
    - casting a ray from the point and count the number of times it intersects with the polygon boundary
    -- if the number of intersections is odd, the point is inside the polygon
    -- if the number of intersections is even, the point is outside the polygon
- maybe fit for finding the line-of-sight (LOS) angle and time-to-collision (trajectory)
    - [to-do] implemented in 3D, in Python
